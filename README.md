## TLDR;
A demo of a machine learning model made to classify photographs of notes, here used on drawings.

## What this is
A year-long graduation project is a requirement of the swedish upper secondary school.
My project, a machine learning model trained to recognize photographs of music notes (middle-C to B), resulted in this demo.

However, the playground restricted me from using the camera as it's not availble in the iOS simulator,
and so I had to find another solution. That solution resulted yield great results.

Additionally I added an algorithm calculating the note from the location of the points in the drawing.
The output from this algorithm acts as a complement to the machine-learning output.

## Dataset
I collected all data in the dataset myself through a combination of a home-made iOS app allowing me to automatically upload
cropped photographs to my webserver and data collected from the open-source sheet website http://www.mutopiaproject.org/
A total of 3000 photographs were collected.
The final dataset contained about 700 photographs (after selecting only the highest-quality datapoints).
