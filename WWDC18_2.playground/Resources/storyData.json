 "heading": "The backstory",
 "text": "As part of my last year in the swedish upper secondary school I've been entitled to work on a project spanning 100 hours. \n After a few internal debates I decided to learn how to, and train, a machine learning model able to identify music notes (to the degree I'm capable of within the restrains). \n \n I wanted to do something helpful for others, and music has an important role in all our lives, so making it easier to learn notes seemed like a good end goal for my project.",

 "heading": "The method",
 "text": "I started looking for a dataset to utilize, unfortunately, none were to find providing individual and labelled notes. So, I built an app for my iPhone in order to later collect over 3000 notes. \n \n I began training the model using Keras and TensorFlow, but when Turi Create was released and proved unmatching performance I made a switch.",

 {
 "heading": "The result",
 "text": "With an accuracy score of 0.92 the model proves a point, that it is possible to finish the project with very restricted resources. \n \n However, that score is for classifying photographs and not drawings. So this is very much an experiment. At the side of the model I added an algorithm doing the classification for comparison. \n \n Now, I'd like to invite you up to the stage for a demo, let's go to the next page."
